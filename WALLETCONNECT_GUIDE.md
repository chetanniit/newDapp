## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your WalletConnect Project ID
1. Visit [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)
2. Create a free account or sign in
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your Project ID
5. Replace the demo Project ID in `src/config/walletconnect.js`

### 2. Update Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
# Copy from .env.example and update with your values
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env`:
```bash
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id-here
VITE_APP_NAME="Your DApp Name"
VITE_APP_DESCRIPTION="Your DApp Description" 
VITE_APP_URL="https://your-domain.com"
```

**Note**: The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing your Project ID.

### 3. Customize Metadata
Update the metadata in `walletconnect.js` to match your DApp:
```javascript
metadata: {
  name: 'Your DApp Name',
  description: 'Your DApp Description',
  url: 'https://your-domain.com',
  icons: ['https://your-domain.com/icon.png']
}
```

## Architecture

- **WalletConnectV2.jsx**: Main wallet connection interface
- **ApproveUsdtV2.jsx**: USDT approval functionality with WalletConnect integration
- **useWalletConnect.js**: React hook for WalletConnect session management

### Flow
1. User clicks "Connect Wallet"
2. WalletConnect modal opens with QR code
3. User scans QR code with mobile wallet or selects desktop wallet
4. Wallet approves connection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Project ID is required"**: Make sure you've set a valid Project ID from WalletConnect Cloud
2. **Connection timeout**: Ensure your wallet supports WalletConnect v2
3. **Transaction failures**: Verify you're on the correct Tron network

### Debugging
Enable debug mode by adding to your browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('WALLETCONNECT_DEBUG', true);
```

## Security Notes
- Never share your private keys
- Always verify transaction details before signing
- Use testnet for development and testing
- Keep your Project ID secure (it's not a secret but should be specific to your app)

- More reliable connections
- Broader wallet support
